CHANGELOG
=========

1.4.0
-----

 *  New option `strict` to enforce additional type conversion and checking.

 *  Several modifications to allow better embedding of the parser (not
    documented).

 *  :warning: `models` that were compiled with earlier versions are no
    longer supported. If you have stored a `model` and you want to upgrade
    to the new version, the model must be recompiled.

1.3.1
-----

 * First tagged version.
